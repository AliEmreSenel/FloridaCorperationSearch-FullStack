# React (Nextjs) Frontend

The frontend uses Tailwind CSS and Nextjs to make a easy to use interface. When running with docker, the frontend is built into a static webpage and served with nginx.

The frontend has a modern search bar, a number input for selecting the amount of results requested and a submit button for initiating the search.
